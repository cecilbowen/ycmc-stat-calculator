discrepancies:
===============
wood effect on dark:
- kuriboh does nothing
- land form WOOD only seems to affect DARK when landAE is > 100%
	probably needs to be that landAE + wood strength > 140
- map DARK doesnt seem to affect EARTH like it says
	okay not in yami_marik-1, but yes in pegasus-2
	ACTIVE RANGE: >= 20 but < 50
- map WIND doesnt seem to affect FIRE like it says
	ACTIVE RANGE: >= 20
	no effect on [
		joey (5), tea(8), mako(10), mai (15)
	]
	effect on [
		// AT+, mod 2
		bakura (20), shadi-1 (20), kaiba-1 (20), odion (30),
		ishizu-2(30), pegasus-2 (35)
		
		// AT-, mod 10
		ishizu-1 (50)
	]
	speaking of, fire reaper bein a bitch not followin the standard
		fire reaper LOSES AT on wind on pegasus2 map, weird
		fire reaper mod is 6 on ishizu1
	fire gains AT on [kaiba-1, ishizu-2, pegasus-2] (mod 2)
	fire loses AT on [ishizu-1] (mod 10), fire reaper discrep
